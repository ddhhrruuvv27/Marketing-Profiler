The US Adult Census dataset is a repository of 32,561 entries extracted from the 1994 US Census database.

The data was cleaned and pre processing was done, by removing all the rows containing one or more missing values from the "adult.data" file.
All the rows containing “?” was marked as NaN (not a number) and finally dropped to obtain the “preprocessed_data.csv”.
